<p>
Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
./configure --help gives a list of possible options with slightly
longer descriptions in README.configure. Read this since here you
can decide what parts of AFD you want to compile and how and where
you want it to install the binaries.
</p>
<p>
If you do not have a configure file you can create it by running the
script ac-tools/bootstrap. This script needs autoconfig and automake.
Here the commands to install them on the different systems:
<ul>
   <li>RedHat/CentOS/Scientific Linux up to 7.x and Fedora up to Version 17</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum install automake autoconf
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>RedHat/CentOS as of Version 8.x and Fedora as of Version 18</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      dnf install automake autoconf
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Debian/Ubuntu</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      sudo apt-get install automake autoconf
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>SLES as of Version 10 and openSUSE</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      zypper install automake autoconf
      </pre>
   </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
But before you start you need to ensure that your system has all the
required packages installed. Here follow some system specific description
on how to install the necessary tools:
<ul>
   <li>RedHat/CentOS/Scientific Linux up to 6.x</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum install gcc make openmotif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Fedora up to Version 17</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm
      yum install gcc make openmotif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Fedora Version 18 - 21 and RedHat/CentOS/Scientific Linux as of 7.0</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum install gcc make motif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel systemd-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Fedora as of Version 22 and RedHat/Alma/Rocky/Centos as of Version 8</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      dnf install gcc make motif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel systemd-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Debian/Ubuntu</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      sudo apt-get install gcc make libmotif-dev libssl-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libxpm-dev libxaw7-dev libsystemd-dev
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>SLES up to 11</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      zypper install gcc make openmotif-devel libopenssl-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>SLES as of 12 and openSUSE</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      zypper install gcc make motif-devel libopenssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel systemd-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>MacOS</li>
   <ul>
      <p>
      For gcc download and install the Apple development environment
      https://developer.apple.com/xcode/. In XCode, install the optional
      components "command line tools" from the "Downloads" preference
      pane, then gcc is available on the Mac.
      </p>
      <p>
      For X11 install XQuartz http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
      zypper install gcc make openmotif-devel libopenssl-devel
      </p>
   </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You need to decide where you want to install AFD and if you want other
users to have access to your AFD. There are three different security
models, the default is "single user" where only the user that has started
the AFD may have access and may control it. "Group access" is where all
members of the same group may see and control the AFD. To activate this
configure must be called with --enable-group_can_write. The third model
is "any user", where any user may see things and have access and
can be activated with the --enable-setuid_progs. The access can be
controlled on a much finer level when using the <a href="afd_users.html">
afd.users</a> configuration file. The "any user" model together with
afd.users will give you the best control over who may do what, but be
aware that some binaries will have the setuid bit flag set. So you should
not use this when the binaries belong to root.
</p>
<p>
Older unix systems may require special options for compilation or
linking that the `configure' script does not know about. You can give
`configure' initial values for variables by setting them in the
environment. Here an example:
</p>
<pre>
            ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
</pre>
<p>
On Linux or newer unix systems you can just say:
</p>
<pre>
            ./configure
</pre>
<p>
Before compiling you might want to set some other preferences in
src/afdsetup.h and/or src/init_afd/afddefs.h. Some of these values
can also be set via configure parameters:
</p>
<pre>
           --with-max-no-of-parallel-jobs=N
           --with-default-no-of-parallel-jobs=N
           --with-default-archive-unit=N
           --with-max-hostname-length=N
           --with-max-dir-alias-length=N
</pre>
<p>
But note with AFD version before 1.4.6, changing some values here might
make this incompatible with a previous AFD version and AFD will no longer
work when it is started. So best to leave these values as they are. If
you do change them it's best to run the following command before starting
AFD again:
</p>
<pre>
            afd -i
</pre>
<p>
This will initialize the internal database of AFD. After this it will be
possible to run AFD with the new values. As of version 1.4.6 this is no
longer required and AFD does it automatically for you.
</p>
<p>
Now everything is setup for compiling, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
            make
</pre>
<p>
To speed up this process try use the -jN parameter, where N is the number
of cpu cores you have available. On Linux you can just say -j$(nproc),
this will get the number of threads it can use automatically.
</p>
<p>
The next step is  to install the binaries. This is done with the following
command:
</p>
<pre>
            make install
</pre>
<p>
The Makefile also has support for generating an RPM. For this to work
the package rpm-build needs to be installed. If this is installed, all
you need to do is run the following command instead of the 'make install':
</p>
<pre>
            make rpm
</pre>
