All events that occur within AFD, can be viewed with the help of this
dialog (see <a href="log.html#event_log">Event Log</a>).
Since the event log can be very extensive, there are lots of possibility
to reduce the search time by filling in some of the following values:
</p>
<center><img src="../images/show_elog_selection.gif" alt="[closeup of selection part]"></center>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter the start and end time of the search. If no value is entered
       it will always take the earliest or latest entries it finds. There
       are two time forms. One is the absolute and the other is the
       relative time format. The following absolute forms are possible:
       MMDDhhmm, DDhhmm and hhmm (MM = month [01-12], DD = day [01-31],
       hh = hour [00 - 23], mm = minute [00 - 59]). The relative form
       always starts with a hyphen '-' and has the following format:
       -DDhhmm, -hhmm or -mm.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>When set the event log will be shown continuously, ie. if new entries
       come they will be shown live as they come in.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>3</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Shows the current date and time in the following format:
       DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>4</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter a host alias name. The name may contain wildcards (*,?,[]).
       Multiple names can be entered by separating them with a comma (,).
       If no host alias name or wild card is entered it will always search
       for all host alias names.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;</tD>
   <td>Enter a dir alias name. The name may contain wildcards (*,?,[]).
       Multiple names can be entered by separating them with a comma (,).
       If no dir alias name or wild card is entered it will always search
       for all dir alias names.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>6</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter a search pattern for the Additional Information part. Again
       one may enter wildcards (*,?,[]).</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Here you can narrow down the search by just searching for certain
       event class.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>8</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Here you can narrow down the search by just searching for certain
       event types.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>9</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The dialog on the right will show up when this button is pressed.
       It allows to narrow down the search for the different event
       actions. Any changes made here will take immediate effect, so
       it is not necessary to close the window.</td>
   <td><img src="../images/event_action_dialog.gif"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to fill in any values, however then the search might
take a very long time for it to finish, depending on how long and how many
log files there are. While the dialog is searching for data, the function
of the search button changes into a stop button, enabling the user to
interrupt the search. This button and the slider of the list widget are the
only buttons that are active during a search. Thus, the user can search in
the list widget by using the slider, while the dialog is still searching.
Once a search is interrupted, the search will always start from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Here follows a short description of the text widgets and the meaning of
each item:

       (01-12) and DD is the day of the month (01-31).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Time</td>
   <td>The time in the following format: hh:mm:ss where hh is the hour
       (00-23), mm is the minute (00-59) and ss is the second (00-59).</td>
</tr>

</center>
</p>
<p>
Under the text box follows a status line showing the number of events
found and the size in bytes. At the end will be the time taken for the
search in seconds.
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_elog_status.gif" alt="[closeup of the status line]"></center>

</p>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>Search</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Pressing this button will start the search. During the search the
       name of the button will change to Stop. Pressing this will interrupt
       the search and the button will be renamed to Search again. Pressing
       search again will start the search from the beginning and not where
       it was when it was interrupted.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>Print</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>This will popup another dialog which can be used to print what is shown
       to a separate file, send it in a mail to someone or print it to a
