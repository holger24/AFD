<p>
The second configuration file for the AFD is used to do a configuration
by host name. There can be as many entries as you want and it must
not always have a corresponding host name in the DIR_CONFIG file or
visa versa. This file consists of a table with 24 entries for each
host. See below for a description of each entry.

   <th valign=top><a name="alias_hostname">Alias hostname</a></th>
   <td>The alias host name. This is the host name that is being displayed
       in the afd_ctrl window and is used in the log files. If a secondary
       host can be specified, ignore the toggling characters, ie. when
       the host name in the DIR_CONFIG file is specified as 'host{12}'
       only state 'host' as host name. The host name may only be 8
       (MAX_HOSTNAME_LENGTH) characters long. If this is to small
       change MAX_HOSTNAME_LENGTH to a larger value and recompile AFD.
       Before you startup AFD with the new values you need to run 'afd -i'
       to initialize internal AFD structures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="real_hostname_1">Real hostname 1</a></th>
   <td>The real host name or IP number of this host. If there is a
       secondary host this will be the primary host, ie. if auto toggle
       is set it will always try to switch back to this address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="real_hostname_2">Real hostname 2</a></th>

   <td>Host switching information. This string holds the toggling
       character to be displayed for the primary and secondary host.
       The two characters must be put in either curly brackets {} for
       automatic host switching or square brackets [] host switching
       by the user.</td>

   <td>If remote server is a proxy, enter the rule on how to
       enter this proxy here. Currently you can only specify the
       order of the user name and the password. To enter the
       user name just enter $U&lt;user name&gt; and the password
       is entered with $P&lt;password&gt;. You may specify as
       many user and password elements as you want, each one must
       however be separated by a ;. If you only put a $U followed
       directly by a ; it will take the user name from the recipient
       entry. The same goes for the password. If the remote server
       requires the ACCT (account) directive instead of the USER
       to enter the login name you may also use $A instead of $U.</td>

   <th valign=top><a name="allowed_transfers">Allowed Transfers</a></th>

<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="transfer_block_size">Transfer Block Size</a></th>
   <td>The size of the blocks being used to send files to the remote host
       (in Bytes). Maximum value is 65536 and minimum is 256. Default
       value is 4096 (DEFAULT_TRANSFER_BLOCKSIZE).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="successful_retries">Successful Retries</a></th>
   <td>This is the number of successful retries to the secondary host
       before it will try to send to the original host to see if it
       has become available again. If a value of less then one is specified
       it will NOT try to go back to the original host. It will from
       then on always send to the secondary host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="file_size_offset">File Size Offset</a></th>
   <td>When transmitting large files and the transfer gets interrupted, the
       AFD can append a file on the remote site. For this it needs to know
       the file size on the remote site. And to get the size it does a dir
       'filename' at the remote site. Due to different replies of the FTP
       servers, the position of the file size is needed. You can easily
       determine this value simply doing an FTP to the remote site and a
       dir and count the spaces to the file size. For example:
       <pre>
     -rw-r--r--   1 afd      mts-soft   14971 Jan  3 17:16
               ^^^ ^   ^^^^^^        ^^^

                |  |     |            |
                1  2     3            4
       </pre>
       i.e. the file size offset is 4. Or if the remote site supports
       the SIZE command you can select -2. Then the remote site will
       tell AFD what the current size is. This seems to be also much
       more reliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="transfer_timeout">Transfer Timeout</a></th>
   <td>The time (in seconds) how long the AFD should wait for a reply from
       the remote site (default 120).</td>

   <td>This flag specifies how to determine the checksum, which CRC to
       use and what action should be taken when we find a duplicate. The
       bits have the following meaning:
       <pre>
      1 (1)          - Only do CRC checksum for filename.
      2 (2)          - Only do CRC checksum for file content.
      3 (4)          - Checksum for filename and content.
      4 (8)          - Checksum of filename without last suffix.
      5 (16)         - Checksum of filename and size.
      16(32768)      - Do a CRC32 checksum.
      17(65536)      - Do a CRC32c checksum.
      24(8388608)    - Delete the file.
      25(16777216)   - Store the duplicate file.
      26(33554432)   - Warn in SYSTEM_LOG.
      31(1073741824) - The timeout value is fixed, not cumulative.
      32(2147483648) - Use full recipient as reference instead of alias name.
