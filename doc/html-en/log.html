<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
There are eight different types of log files used by the AFD: system,
receive, transfer, transfer debug, input, production, output and delete
log. All these files are written in ASCII notation, so they can be
evaluated with standard Unix tools.
</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="system_log"><u>System Log</u></a></h3>
<center><img src="../images/system_log_small.png"></center>
<p>
This is the most important log file for the AFD system administrator.
Here all errors encountered by the AFD are logged. It also gives
the following information:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>When archives are being removed.</li>
   <li>The start/stop of any main process of the AFD.</li>
   <li>Any manipulation of the remote host, such as enabling
       debugging, start/stop transfer, start/stop queue,
       switching hosts either by hand or automatically, etc.</li>
   <li>If any process terminates abnormally.</li>
   <li>Debug information for the programmer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=center><a name="event_log"><u>Event Log</u></a></h3>
<center><img src="../images/show_elog_small.gif"></center>
<p>
All events that occur are held in this log file. A more detailed
description of what events and the format is shown in
<a href="../txt/event_log.txt">this</a> text file.
</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="transfer_log"><u>Transfer Log</u></a></h3>
<center><img src="../images/transfer_log_small.png"
alt="[image of transfer_log dialog]"></center>
<p>
The transfer log tells how many files and bytes are being send to a
particular host and the time when they where send. The general form
of such an entry is as follows:
</p>
<a name="general_form"></a>
<pre>
26 12:17:11 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: 1568 Bytes send in 3 file(s).
|     |      |    |      |     |           |
|     |      |    |      |     |           +----&gt; General message saying how
|     |      |    |      |     |                  many files have been send.
|     |      |    |      |     +----------------&gt; Sum of the size send.
|     |      |    |      +----------------------&gt; The job number.
|     |      |    +-----------------------------&gt; Remote Host Name
|     |      +----------------------------------&gt; Log level.
|     +-----------------------------------------&gt; hh:mm:ss
+-----------------------------------------------&gt; Day of the month.
</pre>
<p>
Currently there are nine different log levels: Fatal &lt;F&gt;, Error
&lt;E&gt;, Warning &lt;W&gt;, Information &lt;I&gt;, Configuration
&lt;C&gt;, Offline &lt;O&gt;, Debug &lt;D&gt;, Trace &lt;T&gt; and
"other information" &lt;#&gt;.
</p>
<p>
More important are the warnings/errors that get logged here that may
have occurred during the distribution. Below is an example of an error
that occurred while distributing files via FTP:
</p>
<pre>
26 07:51:09 &lt;E&gt; ducktown[0]: Failed to open remote file .PAXX82_EDZW_J0570749 (-1). #124 (sf_ftp.c 783)
26 07:51:09 &lt;E&gt; ducktown[0]: 150-Opening BINARY mode data connection for '.PAXX82_EDZW_J0570749'.
</pre>
<p>
The second line is the reply that was received from the remote FTP
server. This makes the finding of errors very easy, since the user
immediately sees what type of error it was and what the reason was
for this error. The number behind the # sign is the message number
that was used by the AFD for this transmission.
</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="transfer_debug_log"><u>Transfer Debug Log</u></a></h3>
<center><img src="../images/transfer_debug_log_small.png"
alt="[image of transfer debug dialog]"></center>
<p>
If the information in the transfer log is not enough, to evaluate
an error the user has the possibility to enable debugging and/or tracing.
Here all activities of the sending/receiving process are being logged. The
form of the output is the same as <a href="#general_form">above</a>. Below
is an example of a debug log output:
</p>
<pre>
13 07:29:51 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: Connected. (sf_ftp.c 204)
13 07:29:51 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: 220-hollywood FTP proxy (Version V1.3) ready.
13 07:29:52 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: Entered user name daisy@hollywood. (sf_ftp.c 253)
13 07:29:52 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: 331-Password required for daisy.
13 07:29:53 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: Logged in as daisy@hollywood. (sf_ftp.c 302)
13 07:29:53 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: 230-User daisy logged in.
13 07:29:53 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: Changed transfer mode to I. (sf_ftp.c 351)
13 07:29:53 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: 200-Type set to I.
13 07:29:53 &lt;E&gt; ducktown[0]: Failed to change directory to /duck_tales (550). (sf_ftp.c 367)
13 07:29:53 &lt;I&gt; ducktown[0]: 550-/duck_tales: Not a directory.
</pre>
<p>
The lines containing the numbers 220, 331, 230, 200 and 550 are always
the reply from the remote FTP server. If you want to know the exact meaning
of these numbers see <a href="ftp-reply-code.html">FTP reply codes</a>
or for a more detailed description see <a href="../txt/rfc959.txt">RFC 959</a>.
In the above example we see that we have failed to change the remote
directory to /duck_tales and that the remote server says that it is not a
directory, but a file or link.
</p>
<h3 align=center><a name="receive_log"><u>Receive Log</u></a></h3>
<center><img src="../images/receive_log_small.png"
alt="[image of transfer debug dialog]"></center>
<p>
The receive log shows the number of files received and if exec option is
set what is done by the exec option in the directories monitored by AFD.
The output is very similar to the transfer log. In this log all errors
will be shown that the AMG encounters while it processes these files
(eg. the exec option).

<p>
The System, Receive, Transfer and Transfer Debug Log can all be viewed
with the X program <a href="show_log.html">show_log</a>.
</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="input_log"><u>Input Log</u></a></h3>
<center><img src="../images/show_ilog_small.png" alt="[image of show_ilog dialog]"></center>
<p>
Here all file names of files that are picked up by the AFD get logged in
the INPUT_LOG.x file. Data for this file is collected for one day
(SWITCH_FILE_TIME). This file is then kept for 7 (MAX_INPUT_LOG_FILES)
days. Every time a new log file is created, the x for all old log files
is incremented by one. Thus the newest log file is always INPUT_LOG.0.
</p>
<p>
An entry might look as follows:
</p>
<pre>
4167b8f8   RADAR_PASW42_LSSW_J0570001|23fe|b72afd25|10f

   |                   |               |      +--------&gt; Directory Identifier

   |                   +-------------------------------&gt; File Name
   +---------------------------------------------------&gt; Unix Time in hex
</pre>
<p>
The time is not entered in a human readable form, so that we do not need
to convert back to the UNIX time when we show the time in the
<a href="show_ilog.html">Input Log Window</a>. Unique number, Directory
Identifier, File Size and Unix Time are hexa decimal values.
</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="production_log"><u>Production Log</u></a></h3>
<p>
If something is being done via one of the options it will be logged to
PRODUCTION_LOG.x. This log is rotated the same way as the INPUT_LOG.x
above.
</p>
<p>
A log entry of this type looks as follows:

All file names that have been distributed successfully are shown in
this file. The log files are stored as described for the Input Log Files
except that they are called OUTPUT_LOG.x. In the DIR_CONFIG the system
administrator can specify with the option <a href="dir_config.html#no_log_output">
no log output</a> that these files are not to be logged. This is useful
when sending lots of small unimportant files, it helps to reduce the CPU
and disk usage.

All file names that have been deleted are shown in this file. The log files
are stored as described for the Input Log Files except that they are called
DELETE_LOG.x. There are lots of ways how files can be deleted by the AFD.
The most common way is when the administrator specifies this in the
DIR_CONFIG file, by either setting the aging option for the <a href=
"dir_config.html#directory_entry">directory entry</a> or by setting the <a href=
"dir_config.html#age-limit">age-limit</a> option in the option part. Other
possibilities are that the administrator removes them from the system,
or the AFD deletes them because the message for this job ID is no longer
available.

An entry in the DELETE_LOG.x file is described below:
