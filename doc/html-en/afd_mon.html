<p>
If there is more then one AFD operational, it might be very helpful to
use afd_mon. This is a program that monitors the status of other AFD's
and the opportunity to control everything from one interface:
<a href="mon_ctrl.html">mon_ctrl</a>. The process afd_mon starts for each
AFD that it needs to monitor a separate process called mon. This process
communicates via TCP/IP with the remote AFD to receive status information
from it.
</p>
<h3 align=center><u><a NAME="AFD_MON_CONFIG">The AFD_MON_CONFIG file</a></u></h3>
<p>
For configuring afd_mon you need to create a configuration file
$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/AFD_MON_CONFIG. The AFD_MON_CONFIG file is divided into
two sections, the first section is for configuring values for the
afd_mon process itself, while the second part is only for configuring
the different AFD's that afd_mon needs to connect to.
</p>
<p>
The syntax to specify the information for an AFD to be monitored is as
follows:
</p>
<center><table border>
<tr>
   <th>Parameter name</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   <th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Alias name</td>
   <td>An alias name not longer then 12 (MAX_AFDNAME_LENGTH) characters,
       describing the AFD that is to be monitored.</td>
   <td>Central-AFD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Hostname</td>
   <td>This will be the hostname or IP number of the AFD that is to be
       monitored.</td>
   <td>ducktown</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Port</td>
   <td>The port number where this AFD can be reached. This allows you
       to monitor more then one AFD on one host.</td>
   <td>4444</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Interval</td>
   <td>The interval at which afd_mon will poll the remote AFD for
       status information. On slow connections a large value should
       be taken here so that it does generate big overhead. However,
       the larger this value is the longer it might take for afd_mon
       to see any status changes.</td>
   <td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Connect time</td>
   <td>With this value it is possible to specify how long we should
       remain connected to the remote AFD. This value will only be
       used if the next value is also non zero. If one is zero both
       will default to zero. Setting this value is only useful
       connection time is the main cost factor, otherwise it is
       best to set this and the next value to zero. This value must
       be set to zero when you want to receive log data from the
       remote AFD.</td>
   <td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Disconnect time</td>
   <td>Determines how long it should remain disconnected before it
       tries to connect again. This value too must be set to zero
       when remote log data is to be collected.</td>
   <td>600</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Options</td>
   <td>Here it is possible to set some additional options. This option
       is a 32 bitmask where the following bits are used:
       <table border>
       <tr>
          <th>Bit</th>
          <th>Decimal</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>1</rd>
          <td>Compression. For ssh compression is being used for the
              communication with the remote system. Compression is
              desirable on modem lines and other slow connections,
              but will only slow down things on fast networks.</td>
       <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>2</rd>
          <td>Instead of just enabling X11 forwarding (-X), enable
              trusted X11 forwarding (-Y).</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>4</rd>
          <td>Do not specify full path to rafdd_cmd and rafd_cmd_ssh
              script.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>System Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>32</td>
          <td>Receive Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>7</td>
          <td>64</td>
          <td>Transfer Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>128</td>
          <td>Transfer Debug Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>9</td>
          <td>256</td>
          <td>Input Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>512</td>
          <td>Production Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>11</td>
          <td>1024</td>
          <td>Output Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>12</td>
          <td>2048</td>
          <td>Delete Log Data.</td>
       </tr>
       </table>
       The options can be combined by adding the decimal values.
       To set, for example, both compression and trusted X11 forwarding
       3 must be specified.</td>
   <td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Remote cmd</td>
   <td>The program used to execute commands on the remote system.
       Only rsh and ssh are supported.</td>
   <td>rsh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Convert user name</td>
   <td>This parameter is optional and can be used to fake another user
       on the remote host. This is useful when you have one central
       login on the machine which runs afd_mon, say donald. But the
       remote host does not have this account, but it has the account
       daisy, then this option can be used to enable donald to call,
       say afd_ctrl, under the account of daisy. You may specify up
       to 5 (MAX_CONVERT_USERNAME) users to be converted each pair
       must be separated by a space.</td>
   <td>donald-&gt;daisy</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
<p>
So a sample entry in the AFD_MON_CONFIG file might look as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   #
   # Configuration file to monitor remote AFD's
   # ==========================================
   #
   # +--------------------------------------------------> Alias
   # |            +-------------------------------------> Hostname
   # |            |       +-----------------------------> Port
   # |            |       |  +--------------------------> Interval
   # |            |       |  |  +-----------------------> Connect time
   # |            |       |  |  |  +--------------------> Disconnect time
   # |            |       |  |  |  |    +---------------> Options
   # |            |       |  |  |  |    |   +-----------> Remote cmd
   # |            |       |  |  |  |    |   |    +------> Convert user name
   # |            |       |  |  |  |    |   |    |
   Central-AFD ducktown 4444 5 30 600 1024 rsh donald-&gt;daisy
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: The syntax of AFD_MON_CONFIG must be correct! The process evaluating
this file is still very primitive and easily falls over any syntax errors.
</p>
<h3 align=center><u><a name="running afd_mon">Starting and stopping afd_mon</a></u></h3>
<p>
For afd_mon to function properly you need to either set the environment
MON_WORK_DIR or AFD_WORK_DIR. Or you can specify the working directory
by starting afd_mon with the -w &gt;path&lt; option. To start afd_mon, use
mafd -a and mafd -s to shut it down again.
